- **Orchid bees**, also called **euglossine bees**
- Tribe of bees of 5 genera:
	- *Euglossa*
	- *Eulaema*
	- *Eufriesea*
	- *Exaerete*
	- *Aglae*
- All in Central and South America
	- Some species expanded to southern US, e.g. *Euglossa dilemma* (green orchid bee) in Florida
- Bright and metallic green, gold and blue colouration in the majority of species
<br>
**Behavior:**
- Females gather pollen and nectar like in other bee species, as well as resin, mud and other materials for nest building

- Males collect fragrant compounds (esters, oils) from orchids with fine mop-like hairs on the front tarsi, then deposit them in openings on specialised hollow tibia of the hind legs
	- In doing so they also pick up the pollinarium; some orchids, like tribes *Stanhopeinae* and *Catasetinae*, are pollinated exclusively by male orchid bees
- Collected fragrances are displayed by wing-fanning the opening to the spongy hind tibia and "spray-ventilating" the contents during mating
- Females not attracted to fragrant compounds in isolation, indicating this behavior isn't strictly pheromonal, but instead a complex mating ritual to advertise genetic quality to females

- *Eufriesea purpurata* males observed to apparently collect insecticides, namely aldrin[^1] and DDT[^2]
